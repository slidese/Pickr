This was an Android app I started to develop but discontinued. The idea was that I wanted to setup a bunch of folders on the phone and whenever a photo or movie was written to that folder it would get uploaded to a Picasa/Google+ Album or a Dropbox folder. Just like the auto upload features the Google+ and Dropbox apps have; but I wanted some more control, i.e. I wanted all Instagram, Path and Paper Camera pictures to go in to the same folder on Google+.

The code is complete as far as it goes. It looks something like this.
